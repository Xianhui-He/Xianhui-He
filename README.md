### I'm Xianhui He :cn: !
- :wink::mortar_board: **I am a master student in **psychology working** with Dr. [Ying Cai](https://person.zju.edu.cn/caiying) at Zhejiang University (Hangzhou, China), where I graduated with a BSci degree in **psychology**.**
     
- :smirk::key: My long-term interest is to understand how human brain transforms visual representation from perception to working memory (WM) to long-term memory. I mainly used  **behavior, sEEG, tES and computational models**.
- :partying_face::grapes: My undergraduate Graduation project is about the differences between confidence and uncertainty in visual working memory. I presented this behavior study in [**WMS2022**](https://www.wmsymposium.org/).
- :thinking::brain: Currently with sEEG recordings and behavioral experiments, I have been examining whether the hippocampal-cortical interactions support 1) WM load, 2) WM context-binding, and 3) the transformation of representation from WM encoding to WM maintenance to Long-term Memory retrieval. 
- :scream::zap: Also, I participate in a project concerning how to improve visual working memory by tES. Our work is presented in [**CNS2022**](https://www.cogneurosociety.org/poster-session-schedule/).

- :monocle_face::surfer: I was an [**NMA2022**](https://academy.neuromatch.io/about) interactive student to build up skills in computational neuroscience. [**Our group project**](https://raclette-project.netlify.app) asks whether sensorimotor cortex represents motion types similarly in actual movement and imagery.

- :film_strip::volleyball: In my spare time, I enjoy watching movies (my favorite director is Ryusuke Hamaguchi) and playing volleballs.
