### I'm Xianhui He :cn: !
- :wink::mortar_board: **I am a DPhil student in experimental psychology** working with Professor [Bernhard Staresina](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/people/bernhard-staresina) at Oxford. I was a master's student in the lab of Dr. [Ying Cai](https://person.zju.edu.cn/caiying) at Zhejiang University (Hangzhou, China), where I also completed my undergraduate education.
     
- :thinking::brain: I studied memory consolidation in the human brain, both in sleep and in waking. I mostly used neural recordings like (i)EEG, fMRI, and sometimes I used neural networks.

- :volleyball::film_strip: In my spare time, I enjoy playing volleyball, taking photos, and watching movies.
